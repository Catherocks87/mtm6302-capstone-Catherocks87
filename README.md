1. I started creating the files `index.html` and `styles.css` in Visual Studio code inside the `part-3` branch.

2. According to my mock-up, I looked for the best options to create the prototype, so I used Bootstrap to make the layout. I included dropdown menus, responsive grids, and buttons along with CSS styles to make this prototype close to the original mock-up, and to make it responsive for two screen sizes, mobile and desktop.

3. Finally, I checked both codes HTML and CSS with [validator.w3.org](https://validator.w3.org) to detect any mistakes, after validation zero errors were found.

One of the challenges doing this prototype was remembering how to use Bootstrap again; I had to recap my previous assignments made with this framework. Also, it took me some time to set the background images the way I wanted to match with the mock-up. I still have more challenges like which will be the best way to display each Pokémon info by clicking its image, but, hopefully, I expect to make this possible with JavaScript help.

**Resources:**
- Bootstrap
- CSS Reset
- Bulbapedia for Pokémon images and info
