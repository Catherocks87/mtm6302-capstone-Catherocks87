# Mockup Design
<p>
For the mockup, I decided to use a color palette inspired by the current Pokemon brand: yellow, blue, and red. However, I opted for pastel variations of these colors. I also chose two easily readable sans-serif fonts, Inter and Jua. Additionally, I have incorporated various UI elements into the layout, including buttons, arrows, and icons, which will assist users in understanding the interface.</p>
